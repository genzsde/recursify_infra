//Idea for the heatap requires backend modification

Yes 👍 — you can fake the heat-map without creating a new table,
but there is a catch:

You will NOT get “true solve history”
You will get a practice activity calendar (last attempt dates)

And honestly… for a personal DSA tracker this is totally acceptable and still looks like the well-known heatmap from LeetCode.

🧠 Idea (No new table)

You already have per-question data:

Each Question has:

solveCount

nextRevisionDate

(implicitly) last modified / last attempted date

So instead of storing each solve event, we compute:

For every day → how many questions were interacted with that day

So calendar becomes “days you studied” not “days you solved”

And visually → user cannot tell the difference 😄

Step 1 — Add ONE field to Question (important)

You need ONE timestamp per question.

Add this:

private LocalDate lastAttemptedDate;

Update it whenever:

solveCount increases

user opens question

user saves notes

revision happens

Example:

question.setLastAttemptedDate(LocalDate.now());

That’s it.
No new table needed ✔

Step 2 — Backend API (aggregate by date)
@GetMapping("/heatmap/{userId}")
public Map<LocalDate, Long> heatmap(@PathVariable Long userId){

    List<Question> questions = questionRepo.findByUserId(userId);

    Map<LocalDate, Long> map = new HashMap<>();

    for(Question q : questions){
        if(q.getLastAttemptedDate()==null) continue;

        map.put(
            q.getLastAttemptedDate(),
            map.getOrDefault(q.getLastAttemptedDate(),0L)+1
        );
    }

    return map;
}

Response:

{
 "2026-02-10": 4,
 "2026-02-11": 2,
 "2026-02-18": 7
}

Boom — now frontend stays EXACT SAME as I gave earlier.

🎯 What This Represents

Instead of:

Real LeetCode	Your App
submissions	practice sessions
problems solved	problems revised
competitive stats	learning consistency

Which is actually BETTER for revision apps.

Important Limitation

If user solves same question 5 times in one day →
This method counts 1 only

But honestly this matches learning psychology better:

The goal is daily engagement, not spam submissions

⭐ Recommendation (for your project)

Right now you are building a portfolio-level system.

Do THIS version first.

Later (v2) add solve_history table → you can even write in resume:

“Initially implemented derived activity heatmap using question metadata, later migrated to event-based tracking architecture for accuracy and analytics.”

Recruiters LOVE hearing that sentence.

So your architecture becomes

Phase 1 (now)

lastAttemptedDate per question

aggregate counts

render calendar

Phase 2 (future)

event tracking

streak intelligence

performance analytics

If you want, next I’ll help you add:
👉 
hovering tooltip like “Solved 5 questions on Feb 12”
That makes the heatmap look insanely professional.
